Your muscles and joints ache, so even simple movements feel heavy. Fatigue hits hard‚Äîyou feel like you could sleep for a whole day and still not be rested. A cough and sore throat make talking or swallowing uncomfortable, and sometimes your head throbs as if someone is pressing on it. Everything feels overwhelming, and you mostly want to rest until your body fights it off."""
